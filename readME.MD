## Assignment Name: :project feature one
## Name: Darshan Kiran Upadhyay

## Student Number: N01617765

## Tasks
- This project feature introduces interactive elements to enhance user engagement. It includes a button animation, a dynamic image slideshow, and a fitness calculator that provides personalized recommendations based on user input.
- Button Animation
    - The button animation code adds a visually appealing hover effect to a specified button and a set of recipe cards. Upon hovering, these elements scale up, providing a more interactive and engaging user experience.
- Slideshow
    - The slideshow feature implements a dynamic image slideshow that transitions between images every 3 seconds. The functionality is achieved using the setInterval function, creating an automatic and visually pleasing image carousel.
- Fitness Calculator
    - The fitness calculator is a key component of this feature, providing users with personalized fitness recommendations. It calculates BMI,  suggests macronutrient ratios, and recommends exercise routines based on the user's fitness goals.

 

## Leaning curve and challenges
    - During the development of this feature, the main learning curve and challenges included implementing the slideshow functionality and refining the hover effects for interactive elements.

## Student Number: N01617765

## Tasks
- This project feature introduces interactive elements to enhance user engagement. It includes a button animation, a dynamic image slideshow, and a fitness calculator that provides personalized recommendations based on user input.
- Form Validation and Submission
    - The JavaScript code ensures that the form is fully validated before submission. It validates fields such as name, age, gender, goal, activity level, contact preference, and contact information (email or phone). Additionally, it includes basic validation for required fields and provides alerts for invalid inputs.
- Diet Plan Generation
    - The diet plan generation logic creates a personalized diet plan based on the user's selections. It considers the user's goal (weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain), activity level, and meal preference to generate a customized diet plan.
- Fitness Calculator
    - The fitness calculator is a key component of this feature, providing users with personalized fitness recommendations. It calculates BMI,  suggests macronutrient ratios, and recommends exercise routines based on the user's fitness goals.

 

## Leaning curve and challenges
    - The primary learning curve and challenges during the development of this feature involved implementing form validation, ensuring the accuracy of user inputs, and refining the logic for generating personalized diet plans.

## Assignment Name: :project feature three
## Name: Darshan Kiran Upadhyay

## Student Number: N01617765

## Tasks
- This project feature introduces interactive elements to enhance user engagement. It includes a button animation, a dynamic image slideshow, and a fitness calculator that provides personalized recommendations based on user input.
- YouTube Video Player
    - The provided JavaScript code establishes a connection with the YouTube API, dynamically loads the script, and creates a YouTube player. The player is configured to start playing the specified video at a given time.
- Creative Element Animation
    - The animation functionality uses the Anime.js library to creatively animate elements on the page. Three groups of elements—recipe steps, ingredients, and macros—are targeted and animated with a sequential delay for an appealing visual effect.
- Implementation Details:
- YouTube Video Player:

        - The YouTube API script is dynamically loaded.
        The onYouTubeIframeAPIReady function is triggered when the API is ready, creating a new YouTube player.
        Creative Element Animation:

        - The animateElements function uses Anime.js to apply sequential animations to specified elements.
        On DOMContentLoaded, recipe steps, ingredients, and macros are selected and animated.
- Usage
    - To integrate the YouTube video player, ensure the YouTube API script is loaded and use the startVideoAtTime function to control video playback.

    - To apply creative element animation, use the animateElements function and pass the desired elements as arguments.

    - Feel free to customize the code to suit your project needs. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the provided code comments for guidance

 

## Leaning curve and challenges
- Learning Experience
    - YouTube Video Player Integration
    - The implementation of the YouTube video player involved learning the YouTube API and understanding how to dynamically load the API script. The process included creating a new player, configuring its settings, and handling events. This allowed for the seamless integration of a YouTube video into the project.

    - Anime.js Animation Library
        - Incorporating creative element animations using the Anime.js library required becoming familiar with the library's syntax and features. 

        - Understanding how to target and animate specific elements, applying sequential delays, and adjusting easing functions were key aspects of the learning process.

- Difficulties Encountered
    - YouTube API Script Loading
    - The dynamic loading of the YouTube API script and ensuring its proper execution posed an initial challenge. Understanding the timing and dependencies for the YouTube API to be ready and create a functional player required careful consideration.

    - Anime.js Staggered Animation
    - Implementing a staggered animation effect using Anime.js for multiple groups of elements was a bit challenging. Coordinating the sequential delays and ensuring smooth, visually appealing animations required experimentation and adjustments.
